# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart HTTP Requests

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart code that uses the `http` package to make network requests.  The code attempts to handle errors, but it may not catch all possible exceptions that can occur during a network request.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to improve error handling.
